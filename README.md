# Inquirer

For this assignment I chose to create 4 JS files to store all of the functionality of the game.  I used 3 constructors to organize the details of the game.  There is a word object which contains a property that holds a letter object for each letter in the word.  There is also a game object which contains the logic for how the game should function.  Lastly, there is a index.js file that contains the inquirer prompts to ask the user questions and collect responses.

## Prerequisites

Command line terminal && Node

## Built With

* Javascript
* NodeJS
* NPM 
* Inquirer (NPM package)
* RandomWords (NPM package)

## Comments

The structure for the game files is index.js > game.js > word.js > letter.js.  Each one builds upon the last.
